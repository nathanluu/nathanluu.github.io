Over the years, I have worked on many projects that striked my interests. I have worked on projects ranging from games to apps. 

There are currently three themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
* [Enfield](http://enfield.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}).

### MyEducationLab

MyEducationLab is a platform where both students and teachers can engage in a highly-interactive online classroom. Students can have access to their grades, assignments and social features. Teachers can monitor student progress, create beautiful assignments and manage their classroom. The program is still being developed. More info to come!

* Monitor student progress easily and see where students need help.
* Beautiful interface allows easy interactipn.
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll's built-in support for Rouge

Additional features are available in individual themes.

### Browser support

Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

These themes are developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
